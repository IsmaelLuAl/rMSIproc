\usage{
ProcessImage(img, performAlignment = F, SNR = 5, peakWindow = 10,
  peakUpSampling = 10, SmoothingKernelSize = 5, BinTolerance = 0.05,
  BinFilter = 0.1, NumOfThreads = parallel::detectCores())
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{an rMSI data object to process.}

\item{performAlignment}{if is true FFT based aligment will be used and the ramdisk overwritted with alignment data.}

\item{SNR}{minimal singal to noise ratio of peaks to retain.}

\item{peakWindow}{windows size used for peak detection. Generally should be similar to peak with number of data points.}

\item{peakUpSampling}{upsampling factor used in peak interpolation fo exact mass prediction.}

\item{SmoothingKernelSize}{size of smoothing kernel.}

\item{BinTolerance}{the tolerance used to merge peaks to the same bin. It is recomanded to use the peak width in Da units.}

\item{BinFilter}{the peaks bins non detected in at least the BinFitler*TotalNumberOfPixels spectra will be deleted.}

\item{NumOfThreads}{the number number of threads used to process the data.}
}
\value{
a intensity matrix where each row corresponds to an spectrum.
}
\description{
Perform all image pre-processing using a multi-threading implementation.
If aligment is used then the hdd files are overwirted with aligned data.
